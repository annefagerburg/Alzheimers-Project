# Alzheimers-Project
I used this code to scrape data about Alzheimer's disease and population for different states. I then created one dataset containing all the information. 

## Data Sources
#### Alzheimers data
The data (alz) for the number of Alzheimer's cases by state can be found at the Alzheimer's Association at the following link: https://www.alz.org/Alzheimer's-dementia/facts-figures#:~:text=More%20than%205%20million%20Americans%20of%20all%20ages%20have%20Alzheimer's,10%25)%20has%20Alzheimer's%20dementia.
The page has an option to look at cases by state, which creates a new webpage with a pdf for the state selected. I looked at and read in the data table for five different states. 
#### State Population Data
The data for the state populations (state_population) can be found at https://worldpopulationreview.com/state. On the site there is a csv file for a table of the US states populations based on the US 2017 census estimates. This is the "csvData.csv" file referenced in the code.
